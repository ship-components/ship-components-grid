## Usage

### ES6/JSX (Recommended)
The component is written using ES6/JSX therefore Babel is recommended to use it. The below example is based on using [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader).
```js
import React from 'react';
import Grid from 'ship-components-grid';

export default class View extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <Grid
        className='grid'
        fitWidth
      >
        {this.props.items.map(item => {
          return (
            <div
              key={item.id}
              // Grid appends a classname to all children. It's required for
              // masonry to work.
              className={item.className}
            />
          )
        })}
      </Grid>
    );
  }
}
```

## Examples and Development
Examples can be found in the `examples/` folder. A development server can be run with:

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This will live reload any changes you make and serve them at http://localhost:8080.

### Webpack Configuration
This module is designed to be used with webpack but requires a few loaders if you are pulling the source into another project.

```shell
$ npm install webpack babel-loader --save-dev
```

Below are is a sample of how to setup the loaders:

```js
/**
 * Relevant Webpack Configuration
 */
{
  [...]
  module: {
    loaders: [
      // Setup support for ES6
      {
        test: /\.(jsx?|es6)$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loader: 'babel'
      },
      // ES6/JSX for external ship-components modules
      {
        test: /\.(jsx?|es6)$/,
        include: [
          /ship-components\-.*\/src/
        ],
        loader: 'babel'
      }
    ]
  }
  [...]
}
```
